the reality is that many students change their majors according to a 2020 bestcolleges study 3 in 5 college grads would change their majors if they could go back

before you commit to a major you should consider several factors including the program cost your salary expectations and the employment rates in that field of study in addition you should think about your personality your academic and professional goals and your interests

here we help you choose a major that resonates with your personal mission values and passions


6 key factors to consider when choosing a major
choosing a major represents a significant step in the college process and it shouldn t be taken lightly here are six factors to consider before choosing a major

1 what are your biggest priorities
some students pursue certain majors primarily based upon salary potential and job demand other students choose majors they re passionate about or highly skilled in

before you choose a major think about which of these three factors economic advantage interest level and ability are most important and relevant to you and your goals

2 what are you interested in
studies have found that students tend to perform better in school when they can focus on their interests unfortunately it s not always easy for people to identify their interests

to get help with this consider taking a personality quiz for example the myers briggs type indicator questionnaire can help you determine subjects that closely align with your personality and interests

this popular assessment uses your habits and attitudes to generate one of 16 personality types written as a combination of four letters examples include isfj introverted sensing feeling and judging and entp extroverted intuitive thinking and perceiving

you can also explore potential areas of study and career paths by joining student clubs volunteering working a part time job on campus managing a side hustle or completing an internship

3 what are you good at
understanding your natural skills and talents can go a long way in helping you make an informed and confident decision when choosing a major

it may be your parents dream for you to be an artist but what if you skew more toward business or science just because someone else has a degree path in mind doesn t mean it s right for you

one way to determine which academic fields best suit you is to take a close look at your high school grades and your act or sat scores doing this can highlight your strengths in specific academic areas

4 what are the highest paying fields
when considering which major to pursue determine how important salary and salary potential weigh into your decision making process if you re motivated by high earnings pursuing a degree in a stem related field may appeal to you

that said some students care more about the importance of their work than the salary offered they don t want a job just for the money popular non stem majors include human services education and visual or performing arts

the bureau of labor statistics provides a regularly updated list of positions offering the highest salaries psychiatrists rank high on this list as do other healthcare professionals like oral and maxillofacial surgeons obstetricians and gynecologists and general internal medicine physicians

if you want a job outside health and medicine positions with high salaries include chief executive physicist computer and information systems manager and architectural and engineering manager

5 how rigorous will the coursework be
some majors may feel harder than others due to factors like the heaviness of homework loads course expectations and the frequency of exams classes in your major will make up a significant portion of your college course load before you declare a major make sure you understand how rigorous your weekly workload will be

indiana university bloomington s 2016 national survey of student engagement determined the most difficult majors based on the average time students spent per week preparing for classes the hardest majors included architecture chemical engineering and aeronautical engineering

easier majors which typically required less prep time included fields like criminal justice communication and public relations

6 what does your academic advisor say
checking in with your academic advisor is an important step to take when deciding on a major

your advisor has likely had similar conversations with hundreds of students and can provide insight into picking a major they may even propose a major you hadn t previously considered that meets your academic and career goals

when speaking with an academic advisor remember that their time is valuable and limited come to the meeting with a list of thoughtful questions to ask

should you double major in college
undergraduates aren t necessarily limited to one field of study most colleges and universities allow you to double major or even triple major normally students who double major choose two academic fields that complement each other though you re not required to do this

for example if you wanted to pursue a career in international business you might double major in business management and a foreign language other popular major combinations include

accounting and finance
engineering and math
political science and philosophy
criminal justice and psychology
if you don t have enough room in your class schedule to pursue two majors you can declare a minor in a secondary subject that interests you

what if you want to design your own major
recognizing that many learners have specific interests and career aspirations many colleges now allow you to design your own interdisciplinary major if you re considering this path be sure to carefully review existing majors to ensure no existing option meets your needs

next consider whether your proposed individual major meets current and future career requirements

lastly speak with your advisor to get their input on important classes to include in your curriculum you can also speak to other students who created their own majors to learn about the pros and cons of this decision

some examples of student created majors include music and technology public education history and psychology of marketing

frequently asked questions about choosing a major
when do you have to declare a major
when you have to depend a major depends on the college in general most schools require you to declare a major by the end of your sophomore year some students may start college with a declared major or undecided individual departments may also set their own rules so it s critical you ask ahead of time about deadlines for choosing a major

even if you pick a major you can always change it later on just note that the later you change your major the more time you may need to spend in college in order to meet your new major s credit requirements

what should you do if you can t decide on a major
if you can t decide on a major you have several options for example you might decide to take a few classes from different disciplines to help narrow your choices and see which subjects appeal to you the most and which you perform best in

you can also meet with your academic advisor to review the pros and cons of the various majors you re considering they can offer advice for figuring out which major s may work well for you based on factors like your level of interest your class grades and your career goals

can you change your major
yes you can always change your major in fact a 2020 bestcolleges study found that 3 in 5 graduates wished they could go back and change their majors to change your major you must meet with your academic advisor and go over your plans

note that if you complete a lot of classes related to one major and then later decide to switch to another you may need to stay in school longer than the typical four years in order to meet your new major s credit requirements this can add significant costs to your degree

does it look bad to colleges if you apply with an undecided major
no generally speaking colleges want students to think carefully about their decisions and not rush into any major if they re unsure admissions committees understand that choosing a major is a big decision especially for applicants who are still in high school

that said some universities may require you to apply for a particular major so you can gain admission to the relevant school or department this is usually the case with more professional majors like nursing and business

how is climate change impacting the world s ocean
the ocean has long taken the brunt of the impacts of human made global warming says un climate change as the planet s greatest carbon sink the ocean absorbs excess heat and energy released from rising greenhouse gas emissions trapped in the earth s system today the ocean has absorbed about 90 percent of the heat generated by rising emissions

as the excessive heat and energy warms the ocean the change in temperature leads to unparalleled cascading effects including ice melting sea level rise marine heatwaves and ocean acidification

these changes ultimately cause a lasting impact on marine biodiversity and the lives and livelihoods of coastal communities and beyond including around 680 million people living in low lying coastal areas almost 2 billion who live in half of the world s megacities that are coastal nearly half of the world s population 3 3 billion that depends on fish for protein and almost 60 million people who work in fisheries and the aquaculture sector worldwide

here are some of the major consequences of the impacts of climate change on the ocean

photocomposition a turtle swimming in the ocean


sea level rise
sea level rise has accelerated in recent decades due to increasing ice loss in the world s polar regions latest data from the world meteorological organization shows that global mean sea level reached a new record high in 2021 rising an average of 4 5 millimeter per year over the period 2013 to 2021

together with intensifying tropical cyclones sea level rise has exacerbated extreme events such as deadly storm surges and coastal hazards such as flooding erosion and landslides which are now projected to occur at least once a year in many locations such events occurred once per century historically

moreover the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc says that several regions such as the western tropical pacific the south west pacific the north pacific the south west indian ocean and the south atlantic face substantially faster sea level rise


photocomposition a turtle swimming in the ocean

marine heatwaves
marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency and have become longer lasting more intense and extensive the ipcc says that human influence has been the main driver of the ocean heat increase observed since the 1970s

the majority of heatwaves took place between 2006 and 2015 causing widespread coral bleaching and reef degradation in 2021 nearly 60 percent of the world s ocean surface experienced at least one spell of marine heatwaves the un environment programme says that every one of the world s coral reefs could bleach by the end of the century if the water continues to warm

coral bleaching occurs as reefs lose their life sustaining microscopic algae when under stress the last global bleaching event started in 2014 and extended well into 2017 spreading across the pacific indian and atlantic oceans


loss of marine biodiversity
rising temperatures increase the risk of irreversible loss of marine and coastal ecosystems today widespread changes have been observed including damage to coral reefs and mangroves that support ocean life and migration of species to higher latitudes and altitudes where the water could be cooler

latest estimates from the un educational scientific and cultural organization warn that more than half of the world s marine species may stand on the brink of extinction by 2100 at a 1 1 c increase in temperature today an estimated 60 percent of the world s marine ecosystems have already been degraded or are being used unsustainably a warming of 1 5 c threatens to destroy 70 to 90 percent of coral reefs and a 2 c increase means a nearly 100 percent loss a point of no return

strategies to stop
procrastination is the act of delaying or putting off tasks until the last minute or past their deadline some researchers define procrastination as a form of self regulation failure characterized by the irrational delay of tasks despite potentially negative consequences 1
according to joseph ferrari a professor of psychology at depaul university in chicago and author of still procrastinating the no regret guide to getting it done around 20 of u s adults are chronic procrastinators 2

no matter how well organized and committed you are chances are that you have found yourself frittering away hours on trivial pursuits watching tv updating your facebook status shopping online when you should have been spending that time on work or school related projects

whether you re putting off finishing a project for work avoiding homework assignments or ignoring household chores procrastination can have a major impact on your job your grades and your life

in most cases procrastination is not a sign of a serious problem it s a common tendency that most people give in to at some point or another

friday fix how to stop procrastinating
causes
remember that time that you thought you had a week left to finish a project that was really due the next day how about the time you decided not to clean up your apartment because you didn t feel like doing it right now

we often assume that projects won t take as long to finish as they really will which can lead to a false sense of security when we believe that we still have plenty of time to complete these tasks 3

one of the biggest factors contributing to procrastination is the notion that we have to feel inspired or motivated to work on a task at a particular moment

the reality is that if you wait until you re in the right frame of mind to do certain tasks especially undesirable ones you will probably find that the right time simply never comes along and the task never gets completed

the following are a few other factors that cause procrastination

academics
researchers suggest that procrastination can be particularly pronounced among students a 2007 meta analysis published in the psychological bulletin found that a whopping 80 to 95 of college students procrastinated on a regular basis particularly when it came to completing assignments and coursework 4

according to researchers there are some major cognitive distortions that lead to academic procrastination 5 students tend to

overestimate how much time they have left to perform tasks
overestimate how motivated they will be in the future
underestimate how long certain activities will take to complete
mistakenly assume that they need to be in the right frame of mind to work on a project
present bias
the present bias is a phenomenon observed in human behavior that may result in procrastination the present bias means that we tend to be motivated more by immediate gratification or rewards than we are by long term rewards this is why it feels good in the moment to procrastinate 3

for example the immediate reward of staying in bed and watching tv is more appealing than the long term reward of publishing a blog post which would take much longer to accomplish

what is cognitive bias
depression
procrastination can also be a result of depression feelings of hopelessness helplessness and a lack of energy can make it difficult to start and finish the simplest task 6 depression can also lead to self doubt when you can t figure out how to tackle a project or feel insecure about your abilities you might find it easier to put it off

4 daily habits people with depression may avoid
obsessive compulsive disorder ocd
procrastination is also pretty common in people with obsessive compulsive disorder one reason is that ocd is often linked with maladaptive perfectionism which causes fears about making new mistakes doubts about whether you are doing something correctly and worry over others expectations of you 7

people with ocd also often have a propensity toward indecision causing them to procrastinate rather than make a decision

embrace indecisiveness to promote change
adhd
many adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd struggle with procrastination 8 when you re so distracted by outside stimuli as well as internal thoughts it can be hard to get started on a task especially if that task is difficult or not interesting to you

is procrastination a mental illness
procrastination itself is not a mental illness but in some cases it may be symptomatic of an underlying mental health condition such as depression ocd or adhd

the relationship between adhd and procrastination
why do you procrastinate
we often come up with a number of excuses or rationalizations to justify our behavior according to researchers there are 15 key reasons why people say they procrastinate 9

not knowing what needs to be done
not knowing how to do something
not wanting to do something
not caring if it gets done or not
not caring when something gets done
not feeling in the mood to do it
being in the habit of waiting until the last minute
believing that you work better under pressure
thinking that you can finish it at the last minute
lacking the initiative to get started
forgetting
blaming sickness or poor health
waiting for the right moment
needing time to think about the task
delaying one task in favor of working on another

types of procrastination
some researchers classify two types of procrastinators passive and active procrastinators 10

passive procrastinators delay the task because they have trouble making decisions and acting on them
active procrastinators delay the task purposefully because working under pressure allows them to feel challenged and motivated
others define the types of procrastinators based on different behavioral styles of procrastination including 11

perfectionist puts off tasks out of the fear of not being able to complete a task perfectly
dreamer puts off tasks because they are not good at paying attention to detail
defier doesn t believe someone should dictate their time schedule
worrier puts off tasks out of fear of change or leaving the comfort of the known
crisis maker puts off tasks because they like working under pressure
overdoer takes on too much and struggles with finding time to start and complete task
what does it mean to feel overwhelmed
procrastinators vs non procrastinators
non procrastinators focus on the task that needs to be done they have a stronger personal identity and are less concerned about what psychologists call social esteem how others like us as opposed to self esteem which is how we feel about ourselves explained dr ferrari in an interview with the american psychological association apa 2

according to psychologist piers steel people who don t procrastinate tend to be high in the personality trait known as conscientiousness one of the broad dispositions identified by the big five theory of personality people who are high in conscientiousness also tend to be high in other areas including self discipline persistence and personal responsibility

the negative impact of procrastination
it is only in cases where procrastination becomes chronic and begins to have a serious impact on a person s daily life that it becomes a more serious issue in such instances it s not just a matter of having poor time management skills it s a major part of their lifestyle

perhaps they pay their bills late don t start work on big projects until the night before the deadline delay gift shopping until the day before a birthday and even file their income tax returns late

unfortunately this procrastination can have a serious impact on a number of life areas including a person s mental health and social professional and financial well being 12

higher levels of stress and illness
increased burden placed on social relationships
resentment from friends family co workers and fellow students
consequences of delinquent bills and income tax returns
friday fix how to stop procrastinating

abstract
germline gene editing gge has enormous potential both as a research tool and a therapeutic intervention while other types of gene editing are relatively uncontroversial gge has been strongly resisted in this article we analyse the ethical arguments for and against pursuing gge by allowing and funding its development we argue there is a strong case for pursuing gge for the prevention of disease we then examine objections that have been raised against pursuing gge and argue that these fail we conclude that the moral case in favour of pursuing gge is stronger than the case against this suggests that pursuing gge is morally permissible and indeed morally desirable

1 introduction
in april 2015 it was announced that gene editing techniques had been used to modify the dna sequences of human embryos for the first time 1 the study by liang and co authors attempted to use the gene editing technique crispr to reverse the genetic mutations that lead to the disease muscular dystrophy the study marked the first time the human germline the dna individuals pass to their children and subsequent descendants had been intentionally modified 2

the rise of gene editing technologies has been rapid while crude genetic engineering technologies have been available for over two decades early techniques did not have serious potential as clinically useful modifiers of human dna they relied on viruses to deliver novel genetic material to the cell this often only changed one of the two copies of the target gene meaning animals had to be bred together to make modifications effective this method also made unintended changes to large segments of the genome and only a small proportion of the modified animals did not suffer serious side effects 3

the development of techniques that use engineered enzymes rather than viruses to alter dna has revolutionised genetic engineering these techniques were given the collective moniker gene editing to reflect their increased efficiency and precision over older methods gene editing techniques have been used to make precise changes to the genes of yeast fish plants rodents pigs and primates in a recent study gene editing was used to inactivate 62 genes of a retrovirus in a pig cell line a significant step towards generating pig organs suitable for xenotransplantation 4 in october 2015 researchers created a beagle with double the normal muscle mass by editing a gene involved in muscle growth 5

despite these far reaching applications public debate has focused on the ethics of human germline gene editing gge 6 some scientists and public interest groups including the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco have called for an international ban on any gene editing research in human embryos the us based national institutes of health maintained that performing such research would cross a line that should not be crossed other scientists have taken a more moderate view in 2015 an international summit co hosted by the us national academy of sciences and us national academy of medicine the uk royal society and the chinese academy of sciences rejected calls for a ban on gge in research instead they argued for a temporary ban on the clinical use of gge that should be regularly revisited as scientific knowledge advances and societal views evolve 7 similarly the hinxton group an international consortium of scientists ethicists and policy experts called for the continuation of gge in basic research and a pause on any reproductive applications 8

in this article we examine the ethics of pursuing gge where pursuing gge would entail at least i allowing scientists significant freedom to conduct gge research and ii the investment of significant public resources in such research we begin in section 2 by outlining the case for pursuing gge both for the direct prevention of disease and as a research tool in section 3 we analyse some of the ethical objections that have been raised against pursuing gge we argue that all of these objections fail we conclude that the moral case in favour of pursuing gge is stronger than the case against and that pursuing gge is thus morally permissible and morally desirable

2 the case for pursuing gge
2 1 the medical case
if proven acceptably safe the most obvious clinical application of gge will be to prevent genetic disease roughly 6 of all babies born have a serious birth defect of genetic or partly genetic origin 9 if we can identify the genes responsible for these conditions it will in principle be possible to prevent these conditions through gge

many believe that gge is unnecessary for this goal couples wishing to avoid genetic disease in their children can use in vitro fertilisation ivf to create multiple embryos all of which can be tested for genetic disease before implantation ivf and pre implantation genetic diagnosis pgd are already widely used to avoid passing on over 250 genetic diseases including cystic fibrosis huntington s disease haemophilia and phenylketonuria

marcy darnovsky the executive director of the non profit organisation the center for genetics and society has claimed that there is no persuasive medical reason to manipulate the human germline because inherited genetic diseases can be prevented using embryo screening techniques among other means 10 this view was also expressed in a nature commentary calling for a moratorium on gge the authors stated that we cannot imagine a situation in which its use in human embryos would offer a therapeutic benefit over existing and developing methods 11

however there is in fact a significant medical case for pursuing gge which we will now outline in doing so and throughout we assume that current people have moral reasons to prevent the occurrence of disease in future people moreover we assume that these reasons apply regardless of whether our current actions to prevent disease make any future people better off than they would otherwise have been

this assumption is consistent with standard views regarding for example the desirability of eradicating infectious diseases such as malaria and smallpox and of adopting policies that reduce smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy most would agree that there are reasons to adopt such measures and policies even if they will not affect anyone who currently exists these reasons are best understood as reasons to prevent the occurrence of disease in future people moreover most would accept that there are reasons to adopt such measures and policies even if doing so will affect no currently existing person and affect which future people exist so that they make no future person better off than they would otherwise have been

2 1 1 single gene disorders for some couples using gge may be the only way to avoid passing on single gene disorders approximately 19 of women undergoing ivf only produce one viable embryo 12 imagine that two carriers of the gene for cystic fibrosis cf wish to have a child together they have a one in four chance of having a child with cf they use ivf because they want to avoid this outcome however they only produce one embryo and this has two copies of the cf gene and will thus develop cf in cases such as this selection is not an option however gge could be used to prevent cf
even when couples produce more than one embryo in some cases selection will not avoid disease in late onset dominant conditions like huntington s disease some patients carry two copies of the disease causing gene this means that every embryo produced from their gametes will be predisposed to disease gge will be the only way such individuals could have children that are biologically related to them and who are not predisposed to disease

therefore a straightforward medical application of gge is to allow single gene disorders to be avoided in cases where selection is not possible

some might object that such cases are very rare yet even if gge would only enable a small number of additional people to avoid passing genetic diseases onto their children this still generates a reason to pursue it recall we are assuming that we have reasons to prevent disease in future people

moreover even in cases where ivf and pgd can be used to avoid genetic disease in a couple s offspring gge may have the advantage of preventing disease in subsequent generations as well in the case of autosomal recessive disorders children who are born as the result of pgd are often carriers of the condition their parents selected against these individuals have a greater than normal risk of themselves having children with the disease

imagine a couple who both carry the gene for muscular dystrophy md and wish to avoid passing the disease on to their children if these parents use gge all disease causing genes can be removed from an embryo in the absence of spontaneous mutations this will make it impossible for their children and their grandchildren to develop md even though genetic selection could in theory be used to select a non carrier this could require creation of a large number of embryos which may not be possible if they use pgd their child may still be a carrier of the md gene and their grandchildren will still be at risk of developing md this couple might reasonably prefer gge to pgd and it is plausible that we have reasons to enable the fulfilment of such reasonable preferences for example by pursuing gge

moreover even leaving aside prospective parents preferences cases such as this suggest that there is reason to pursue gge using gge to remove all disease causing genes from an embryo will lower the total frequency of disease causing genes in the gene pool and therefore the incidence of such diseases in future generations and this on the assumption we introduced above is an outcome that we have reason to bring about

finally genetic selection replaces one individual with a disease with a healthy individual it does not benefit those with disease its benefits are impersonal gge on the other hand could provide benefits to individuals who would otherwise be born with genetic disorders it could cure their disorders 13 in cases where the embryo will in any case be brought to term and in the absence of gge would be afflicted by disease its benefits are arguably person affecting it is plausible that person affecting benefits are more important than impersonal benefits 14

these considerations show that were gge developed to the point that it could be used to avoid single gene disorders there would be strong reasons to use it in some cases gge would be a more widely applicable intervention than pgd as it would allow people to avoid genetic diseases in cases where selection is not possible it would also be a more effective intervention insofar as it would allow families to remove all disease causing genes from their lineages minimising the risk of disease in their decedents and future generations and it has the potential to produce person affecting benefits

2 1 2 other disorders most common diseases are not the result of single gene mutations they are the result of a polygenic disposition together with environmental influences for example genome wide association studies have identified at least 44 genes involved in diabetes 15 35 genes involved in coronary artery disease 16 and over 300 genes involved in common cancers 17
traditional selection methods like ivf and pgd are not powerful enough to select against polygenic diseases 18 say 20 genes contribute to a particular trait if a couple wish to use pgd to select for 20 different genes in an embryo they would need to create around 10 000 embryos to make it sufficiently likely that one will have the right combination at all 20 loci during routine ivf couples rarely produce more than 10 embryos this would give them less than a 1 chance of being able to select an embryo with the desired genotype

gge allows multiple changes to be made to a single embryo and could therefore target many different genes simultaneously it has already been used to make more than 60 simultaneous changes in animal embryos and this number can be expected to increase this ability could make gge a powerful disease preventing technology three out of every ten deaths in those under 70 are caused by chronic diseases like cancer diabetes and heart disease gge could be a powerful tool in the fight against these diseases and could ensure that those treated with gene editing have the best chance to live healthily into old age

we currently do not understand the genetics underlying common polygenic diseases well enough to consider using gge to reduce their incidence but it is clear such applications are a long term possibility

some might object that as polygenic disorders have environmental causes as well as genetic ones gge is unnecessary to prevent them even if we determine the genetic changes needed to prevent or reduce the risk of these disorders we could more easily use environmental interventions but it does not follow from the fact that a disease is partly or even primarily caused by environmental factors that environmental interventions are effective in preventing it let alone the most effective means of prevention the environmental causes might be more difficult to identify or alter than the genetic causes and even when we can identify the environmental causes polygenic disorders may be optimally prevented by biological interventions for example using gge techniques to make the immune system more efficient at destroying cancer cells might be the best way to reduce the incidence of cancer even if cancer is predominantly caused by environmental factors indeed the fact that polygenic disorders currently result in so many premature deaths despite the fact we have identified many of their environmental risk factors indicates we need to explore novel approaches to their treatment

in addition in most cases we should not think of environmental and genetic prevention techniques as mutually exclusive alternatives even where environmental interventions could be somewhat effective in preventing a disease they are unlikely to reduce the risk of disease to zero suggesting that there will still be a case for deploying genetic interventions alongside environmental ones

another speculative long term medical benefit of gge is spreading resistance to infectious diseases 19 some people have genes that make them resistant to particular pathogens in cases of infectious disease outbreaks gge could ensure that everyone born in a region is resistant to local pathogens imagine an ebola outbreak that surpasses traditional means of containment as genetic background determines susceptibility to ebola 20 genes that make individuals highly resistant to ebola may soon be identified in such a case gge could be used to spread resistance genes in a population effectively immunising the next generation

such actions will be highly impractical if gge could only be performed through ivf but in the future it may be possible to perform in vivo germline gene edits in vivo gene edits of muscle stem cells have been performed in mice 21 indicating that in vivo edits of spermatogonial stem cells sscs in humans may be feasible in the future using gene editing on ssc s in the testes could modify all the sperm that a male produces thus ensuring they pass on particular changes to all of their descendants this could allow resistance genes to spread quickly through populations without the need for ivf

all of the benefits discussed in this section 2 1 2 are highly speculative however given the large disease burden caused by infectious and polygenetic diseases the potential benefits are highly significant they add further weight to the medical case of pursuing gge

2 2 the research case
even if the medical case in favour of pursuing gge fails it would not follow that all gge should be banned or that it should be deprived of significant public resources gge has an important role in basic research which should be distinguished from its potential applications in disease prevention

many jurisdictions permit and fund embryo research that seeks to further our understanding of early development and gge could have a unique and beneficial role to play in this research using gene editing techniques researchers can investigate the role of genetics in human development indeed this was the motivation of the researchers who lodged the first application to perform gge in the united kingdom

we currently do not understand many aspects of human development for instance the process by which embryonic cells differentiate into specialised cell types remains largely a mystery recent evidence suggests that our current models which are based on studies in mice may be wrong 22 using gge to investigate the activity of particular genes in early human embryos would help unlock the secrets of early development this could potentially lead to non gge based clinical advances in the future such as improving ivf success rates and reducing the incidence of miscarriage 23

gge could also improve our understanding of genetic diseases embryonic stem cells altered to carry disease causing mutations can be used as models of genetic disease and substrates for in vitro drug testing for example embryonic stem cell lines could be created that carry the mutations associated with parkinson s disease and then induced to grow into nerve cells which malfunction in parkinson s disease potential drugs for parkinson s disease could then be tested on these nerve cells this could expedite the development of pharmacological treatments

while such research currently takes place using induced pluripotent stem ips cells embryonic cells may have technical advantages 24 ips cells are created from somatic cells which may have undergone so called epigenetic changes as a result ips cell lines are more diverse and behave less predictably than embryonic cell lines drug screening conducted on gene edited embryonic cells may lead to more reliable results

similar techniques could be used to generate stem cell therapies embryonic stem cells could be modified to carry alterations that provide protection against some disease these cells could then be grown into various cell types for direct therapies for example gene edited embryonic cells could be used to create immune cells that target cancer these modified cells could then be used as part of cancer treatments although using ips cells in this way will be effective in some cases 25 embryonic cells contain fewer epigenetic changes and they could potentially have some unique applications

the fact that the use of gge in research could produce substantial benefits generates further pro tanto reasons in favour of allowing and funding some forms of germline gene editing gge could help us unlock the secrets of human development and the genesis of disease such knowledge may be valuable in its own right in addition to leading to non gge based treatments in the future

in sum there are significant reasons in favour of pursuing gge in the short term gge may be a valuable research tool and provide a novel treatment for single gene disorders in the longer term gge could be an important tool in the fight against polygenic and infectious disease

3 objections to pursuing gge
in the above section we argued that there is a significant case in favour of pursuing some types of gge in this section we analyse some of the arguments that have been offered against the pursuit of gge to determine whether they undermine this case

3 1 safety
many believe gge research ought not to be permitted or funded because it is unsafe

the national institutes of health nih point to serious and unquantifiable safety issues in justifying their negative stance toward gge research 26 concerns for safety were also prominent in commentaries which appeared in nature and science calling for gge to be halted or strongly discouraged 27

the most obvious safety concerns regarding gge stem from what are called off target mutations unintended changes to the genome off target mutations could potentially result in the development of cancer and other pathologies gene editing performed on human embryos that would subsequently be brought to term therefore risks causing disease and disability

are the safety risks associated with off target mutations strong enough to justify prohibiting or declining to fund all forms of gge research this is a familiar question nearly all medical research poses safety risks to participants safety risks are therefore routinely considered as part of research ethics frameworks 28 the first step in assessing safety risks is identifying who is at risk of harm thus when assessing the risks of gene editing in human embryos we should begin by asking who may be harmed by this research

some will say that the embryo itself is at risk of harm but it is doubtful that the embryo is the type of entity that can be harmed or at least harmed in a morally significant way the embryo does not have experiences or desires and on some accounts of wellbeing entities that lack experiences and desires have no wellbeing and thus cannot be harmed moreover even if embryos can be harmed it is doubtful whether harms to embryos have enough moral significance to justify prohibition or non funding of otherwise valuable research indeed many jurisdictions currently permit and fund embryo research that involves certain destruction of the embryo and this is widely thought to be permissible similarly many jurisdictions permit and fund abortion and the discarding of unwanted ivf embryos it is doubtful that one could hold these practices to be permissible as many do while holding that the death of even an early embryo counts as a morally weighty harm

finally even if the death of an embryo does count as a morally weighty harm this may not count decisively against pursuing gge in all circumstances this is because if gge is developed to the point that it becomes safe for therapeutic uses it could be used as a replacement for pgd which itself often results in the destruction of excess embryos thus development of gge could potentially reduce the number of human embryo deaths that will occur in the future 29

it is harms to future people not embryos that are the most plausible basis for objections to gge if the embryos used in this research are brought to term the children who are born as a result of these technologies could develop cancer or other diseases as a result of off target mutations

there is however an easy way to protect future people from these safety risks ensure none come into existence as long as gge results in off target mutations we can ensure that these safety risks are avoided by making sure that none of the embryos used in the research are allowed to develop to the point that they are the subjects of morally weighty harms

the study by liang and co authors shows how the safety risks of gge can be negated the study was not conducted on embryos that were destined to be born or indeed even had the potential to be born the researchers used triploid embryos embryos that have an extra set of chromosomes these embryos cannot survive pregnancy and are normally spontaneously aborted trialling the crispr system in these embryos had no chance of resulting in a live birth although the study did find a high rate of off target mutations these did not result in morally significant harm

regulations that govern embryo research in several countries that allow such research are already sufficient to protect future people from the safety risks of gge research the uk for instance has laws allowing limited forms of genetic research to be conducted provided that the embryo is destroyed by 14 days and not implanted into a woman 30 given this legal requirement and assuming compliance with the law no gge research conducted in the uk risks harming any future child
